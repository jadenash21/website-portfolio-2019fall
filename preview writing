For my preview, I created a portfolio to display why I am a qualified candidate to be hired at various companies. I was advised as a media and communications major, that I should have a personal website outside of linked in where employers could see for themselves my works, writings, and content creation if they please. Originally, I was going to create this page using wix. However, when we were tasked to create a website of our own, I figured that this could also be an opportunity to showcase my skills for composing and coding. To give a context at what a viewer may be looking at when they log on my site, it essentially will be a digital interview. Questions like prior work experience, personality, and background will all be answered on my page. Right now, in the preview, the viewer has the opportunity to learn a little about who I am. They are greeted by my name in a bold way. Just like a resume, my name is the header. I want people to know that I am the focus of this website. Next, I have my descriptive paragraphs begining. I have broken them down into lists or bullet points just like it would be found on a resume. I have a point for current state of residence, which opportunities I am seeking, my major and univeristy. Next, in bold letters, I have a call to action line urging employers to connect with me about career opportunities. Finally, I added an associated link so people can look at my ambassador work on instagram.
